[Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey](https://github.com/Baroj-MoU/DataCamp_projects/blob/main/R/Exploring%20the%20Kaggle%20Data%20Science%20Survey/notebook.ipynb)

In this project, we are going to find out what tools and languages professionals use in their day-to-day work. Our data comes from the Kaggle Data Science Survey which includes responses from over 10,000 people that write code to analyze data in their daily work.
