These are my solutions to the DataCamp projects

[Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey](https://github.com/Baroj-MoU/DataCamp_projects/blob/main/R/Exploring%20the%20Kaggle%20Data%20Science%20Survey/notebook.ipynb)

In this project, we are going to find out what tools and languages professionals use in their day-to-day work. Our data comes from the Kaggle Data Science Survey which includes responses from over 10,000 people that write code to analyze data in their daily work.


[Visualizing COVID-19]( https://github.com/Baroj-MoU/DataCamp_projects/blob/main/R/Visualizing%20COVID-19/notebook.ipynb)

In this notebook, you will visualize COVID-19 data from the first several weeks of the outbreak to see at what point this virus became a global pandemic.


[Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy]( https://github.com/Baroj-MoU/DataCamp_projects/blob/main/R/Visualizing%20Inequalities%20in%20Life%20Expectancy/notebook.ipynb)

Life expectancy at birth can vary along time or between countries because of many causes: the evolution of medicine, the degree of development of countries, or the effect of armed conflicts. Life expectancy varies between gender, as well. The data shows that women live longer that men. Why? Several potential factors, including biological reasons and the theory that women tend to be more health conscious.
